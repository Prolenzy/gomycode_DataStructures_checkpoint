Project title: sum_distinct_elements


This is an algorithm that compares each element of set1 with the set2 and if element is not present, it's then added to sum. 
Once the first step is done, we do the vice versa to add elements from the second set.
The "for" loop iterates through each element of the two sets trying to find the distinct element.
The loop then checks whether the element is in the distinct_elements array; the element can then be added into the array if not present.
The sum of the distinct elements will then be calculated and stored in the "sum" variable. 


Project title: dot_product


The dot_product calculates the dot product of two vectors 
The v1 and v2 are arrays that represent the the input vectors
We assume the arrays are of the same length and 'n' is the length
'ps' stores the results of the dot product
The 'for' loop iterates through each vector element  and multiplies the corresponding elements, finally accumulating the results in the 'ps' variable 
The use of check_originality_function and check_originality_procedure checks the originality of the functions using a procedure and function to demonstrate different parameter passing mechanisms.
